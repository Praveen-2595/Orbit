## What Is ORBIT?

Most productivity apps ask: *"Did you do the thing?"*

ORBIT asks: *"Do you remember why the thing matters?"*

ORBIT is not a to-do list. Not a habit tracker. Not Notion.

It's a **living companion** — an AI that knows your long-term dreams, your weekly goals, and your daily checklist, and connects all three into one coherent picture. The AI talks to you like a person: sometimes about your goals, sometimes about nothing in particular. It remembers what matters to you.

> *"ORBIT should make users feel like their life is moving — not like they're failing a productivity system."*

---

## The Core Difference

```
Other apps:    Did you complete your task? ✓ / ✗

ORBIT:         You have 3 days until your exam.
               You said your parents are depending
               on this. You've studied 2 hours.
               The gap is real now — not hypothetical.
```

That's the **Stakes Engine** — ORBIT learns what you're actually risking, not just what you're tracking.

---

## Features

### 🎯 Three-Layer Life System
Everything in ORBIT connects upward:
```
Daily habits & checklist
        ↓ feeds into
Short-term goals (weeks/months)
        ↓ feeds into  
Life Vision (1yr / 3yr / 5yr)
        ↓ all seen by
AI Companion — talks freely across all layers
```

### ⚠️ Doom Meter
A real-time pressure gauge that rises every hour you're not progressing toward your goals. Not just a completion bar — it measures your **actual pace vs required pace** with deadline-aware urgency multipliers.

```
0–25%   🟢 SAFE      Calm companion. Goals are background context.
25–50%  🟡 RISING    Firm. Flags what needs attention today.
50–70%  🟠 WARNING   Urgent. Names what's at risk.
70–85%  🔴 DANGER    Honest intervention. References your deadlines.
85–100% 🔴 CRITICAL  Brutally honest. Activates stakes engine.
```

### 🧠 Stakes Engine
The feature that makes ORBIT unforgettable.

During onboarding, ORBIT asks what you're **actually risking** — not your productivity goals, but the real consequences. Who depends on you. What failure looks like in your life. What success unlocks.

When doom rises above 50%, the AI doesn't say *"you're behind on DSA."*

It says *"the interview your parents are depending on is in 3 days. You've studied 2 hours."*

### 🤖 AI Companion (Claude-powered)
- Talks freely — not every message is about goals
- Remembers facts from every conversation automatically
- Personality shifts with doom level
- Dynamic first message based on time of day
- Stakes-aware responses at high doom
- Free conversation mode — sometimes you just need to talk

### ✉️ Letter to Future Self
Write a letter to yourself 90 days from now. Sealed. Locked. Revealed automatically on day 90.

Nobody abandons an app holding a letter from their past self.

### 🎮 Level System
```
○  Drifting        — finding your gravity      (0–99 pts)
◐  Waking Up       — something is shifting     (100–299 pts)
◑  Rising          — momentum is building      (300–699 pts)
◕  In Orbit        — you found your rhythm     (700–1499 pts)
●  Locked In       — nothing can stop this     (1500–2999 pts)
★  Unstoppable     — you became the goal       (3000+ pts)
```

### 🍅 Pomodoro Timer
- Circular SVG progress ring
- Short break (5m) and long break (15m) modes
- Saves progress when stopped — resume or log it
- Auto-logs hours to linked goal on completion
- Custom duration settings

### 📊 Overview Dashboard
- Doom trend chart (last 7 days)
- Habit completion heatmap (last 28 days)
- Focus sessions bar chart (this week)
- Goal progress bars with expected-pace markers
- Weekly summary — "best day", habit rate, hours logged

### 🔄 Retention Hooks
- **Bad Day Protocol** — when doom hits 80%+ at 8pm, AI switches to compassion not pressure
- **Miss Me Message** — after 2+ days away, opens with a personal contextual message
- **Relapse Recovery** — auto-adjusts goals on return, reduces doom 30%, removes shame
- **Reality Check Card** — shows your own words back when you're slipping
- **Weekly Identity Report** — narrative of who you were this week, not just metrics

## Philosophy

ORBIT is built around one belief:

**Goals exist to serve your life — not the other way around.**

The doom meter creates pressure. The stakes engine makes it personal. The AI companion makes it human. And the free conversation mode makes it safe to just... exist, without always performing productivity.

The north star: *help people live intentionally without losing the joy of living freely.*

---
